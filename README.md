# Portfolio-Website

Portfolio website showcasing my interest in technology, education, employment history, projects and interests.

To create the website I learnt the fundamentals of HTML and CSS and used various AWS services to host it: S3 for static web hosting, Route 53 for DNS, CloudFront for content delivery and ACM for SSL/TLS certificate.
